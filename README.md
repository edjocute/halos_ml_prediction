# halos_ml_prediction

This is my project for ISYE 6740 Fall 2020.

I examine haloes from the cosmological simulations Illustris and Illustris-Dark and identify matching haloes across the two simulations. The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to predict halo properties in Illustris solely from the Illustris-Dark counterpart.

Please see the Jupyter notebook and accompany write for more details.
